## Survey Form (freeCodeCamp challenge)

This project was created to fulfil an element of the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp.  
The main aim of the project is to create a simple survey form in order to learn how to use various form elements, such as dropdown menus, checkboxes, textboxes etc.

## Project Criteria

The required user stories are:  
1. I can see a title with id="title" in H1 sized text.
2. I can see a short explanation with id="description" in P sized text.
3. I can see a form with id="survey-form".
4. Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field with id="name".
5. Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with id="email".
6. If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
7. Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field with id="number".
8. If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
9. If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
10. For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label".
11. For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see placeholder text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.
12. Inside the form element, I can select an option from a dropdown that has a corresponding id="dropdown".
13. Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of radio buttons. Each group should be grouped using the name attribute.
14. Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute.
15. Inside the form element, I am presented with a textarea at the end for additional comments.
16. Inside the form element, I am presented with a button with id="submit" to submit all my inputs.  

The project is submitted via Codepen, using a CDN link to run tests to verify completion of the user stories:

## Design

I decided to create this with a basic comic-book style, in contrast to other, more formal, projects.  
I chose bold, primary colours and a stylistically appropriate set of fonts.  
Other than the required elements, I chose to experiment with the following additional techniques:  
1. Colour gradient in the header text
2. Text outline, to enable me to use coloured text which stands out against a detailed background image
3. A fixed background image, over which the content of the page will scroll
4. Basic use of hover on the submit button
5. A responsive resizing of the page, sizing all elements in relation to the width of the user's viewport

## Conclusion

This is by far the simplest of the five projects submitted in fulfilment of the Responsive Web Design Course
